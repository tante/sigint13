# Presenter Notes

* I work on how the digital world changes us
* And I have a subtitle!

---

# Regulating technology and data use

# Presenter Notes

* Subtitle
* Talk: How should we regulate tech and the usage of data?

---

# Regulation

# Presenter Notes

* Not a popular topic really
* You tend to piss someone off
* takes away options/freedom

---

# Examples of Regulation

![Examples of regulation](images/regulationexamples.png)

# Presenter Notes

* Examples of regulation (amonst others)

---

# Definition 

.fx: bigtext

"Regulation creates, limits, or constrains a **right**, creates or limits a **duty**, or allocates a **responsibility**."

# Presenter Notes

* creating rights? Hellyeah!
* But the rest? Meh to Boooo!

---

# Why regulate?

* Protection
* "General Will"
* Interest Group transfers
* Irreversibility
* ...

# Presenter Notes

* Protecting weaker entities
* "General WilL" vs. the "Will of all" (Rousseau)
* Transfers as in redistribute wealth
* Irreversibility: "We only borrowed the world from our kids"
* There are more but these are key

---

# Who regulates?

<img src="images/regulations.jpg" style="float:right">

* "the Mainstream" 
    * (Social norms)
* Trade associations
* Contracts
* etc. 

But mostly the **Government**


# Presenter Notes

* What you can do without punishment
* Treaties and whatnot
* Every community/country has sort of its own approach/flavour
    * (Gun laws in Germany vs. Gun laws in the US)
    * Also more general: regulatory or libertarian

---

# Regulation is about **power**

# Presenter Notes

* The power to enforce a certain behavior
* Or punish certain offenses/misbehaviors

---

# Regulation is everywhere

# Presenter Notes

* the law transcends every aspect of life
* social norms as well
* But today we look at a certain aspect of regulation

---

# Examples of regulation of tech

* guns/weapons
* cars
* nuclear power plants

* Bad example: German "Hacker Paragraph"

# Presenter Notes

* they do mostly work
* many have evolved over a long while
* only mostly
* so why is it so hard?

---

# The Hacker Paragraph

# Presenter Notes

* §202c StGb
* Punishment up tp one year
* for giving access or distributing "Hacker Tools"
* We know it's stupid, but what's the actual reason?  

---

# "Dual Use"

# Presenter Notes

* (not exactly, dual use is about military and peaceful)
* Technologies that have a bias can be regulated quite well
    * guns
* Technologies with dual use way worse
    * knives
    * hacker tools

---

# Regulation is hard

# Presenter Notes

* Many of not most tech objects are not simple
* Overregulation is bad (Hacker Paragraph)
* Under regulation can be bad as well (US gun laws)

---

# What's good regulation?

* As small as possible
* Solves a real problem
* Consistent
* Precise 
    * (but too precise)

# Presenter Notes

* It's always a limitation so let's not overuse it
* It needs a clear problem to address
* It has to fit in with the rest of the rules
    * Or it's hard to follow/understand/legitimize
* It needs to be very clear what it forbids/regulates
* always hard to find middle ground
---

# Regulation is hard, why are we even speaking about this shit?

# Presenter notes

* Why not  do something nice?
* Well it's Google's fault

---

# Google GLΛSS

![Google Glass](images/googleglass.jpeg)

# Presenter Notes

* April 4th 2012 first concept video
* Before anyone had any specs we had an outcry
* "Glassholes"
* "Gargoyles" (Snow Crash, Neil Stephenson)

---

# Criticism 

* Surveillance 
    * Camera
    * Microphone
* Google
    * Instant upload
    * potentially: face recognition
* Loss of trust and privacy

# Presenter Notes
* Constant potential recording
* Google is a company that has its own interests
    * collects a lot of data
* Nobody would feel safe anymore

---

# No GLΛSS Zone

![No Glass Zone](images/noglasszone.png)

# Presenter Notes

* but resonated quite well
* "Glass on the toilet?"
* Was in fact a publicity stunt
---

# Playing catch-up

# Presenter Notes

* This approach has a big problem
* Whenever you regulte a tech like this you play catch up
* small change: New Product

---

# Some people realized that

# Presenter Notes

* And they chose a wider approach

---

# Stop Cyborgs

![Stop Cyborgs](images/stopcyborgs.jpg)

# Presenter Notes

* Smarter
* Broader Approach (at least in name)
* "Butlerian Djihad"
* Pointed out a big problem

---

# For the record: GLΛSS provides nothing new, just makes it visible.

# Presenter Notes

* each smartphone can record the same things
* for 100€ you get sunglasses with HD cameras and 32GB of storage

---

# Let's get back to cyborgs

# Presenter Notes

* I love saying that

---

# Cyborgs

.fx: bigtext

"A cyborg, short for <br><b>cyb</b>ernetic <b>org</b>anism,<br> is a being with **both**<br> **organic** and **cybernetic** parts."
<span style="font-size:25px">(Wikipedia)</span>

# Presenter Notes

* Enno Park talked about cyborgs yesterday
* Glass makes our own cyborgism visible, perceptible
* (But we have been cyborgs for a long while)
* Our digital exosekeleton belongs to us, is part of us

--- 

# Backfire

# Presenter Notes

* Now we basically declared technological devices parts of us
* that makes regulation hard
    * prohibiting in electronics what is allowed in bio

---

# "But we are not *really* regulating **devices** we are regulating the gathering and processing of **data**"

# Presenter Notes

* Defense
* People know that regulating devices is hard (dual use)
* In the glass case it's about what people can do with it
    * surveillance etc

---

# What is data?

# Presenter Notes
* we know tech
* we know what works and what doesn't
* So is data just tech?
    * so we know how to handle it
* What is data?

---

# Data == Cyborg? 

![Commander Data](images/data.jpg)

# Presenter Notes

* Naaa, that isn't right

---

# Short philosophical detour 

# Presenter Notes

* Don't worry it won't hurt


---

# The mind, the body and the world

# Presenter Notes

* You are your mind (software)
* Your mind "runs" on hardware (Body and Brain)
* How do you access the world?
    * Your hardware creates data from the world (somehow)
    * data is not the world because data often lies
* "You" only have data

---

# End Detour

# Presenter Notes

* And we're back on track

---

# Data is the **representation** of<br> a part of **reality**.

# Presenter Notes

* Data codifies aspects
* Names, Age, color
* Can all be expressed as data

---

# Data is nothing without Interpretation

# Presenter Notes

* What is a "33"? An age? A length? A price?
* wax figures (Madame Toussaud's)
    * what you do with an object in front of you depends on your interpretation

---

# Data -> Information -> Knowledge

# Presenter Notes

* We transform Data through Interpretation into Information
    * 0111010100 => JPG
    * sometimes we make a mistake (wave cryptocat)
* We transform information to knowledge by integrating it in our mind

---

# Data is our access to the world

# Presenter Notes

* Regulating data needs to be done very carefully
    * we'd never allow "You must not look at red things"
* Data is in the end what allows us to make decisions
* Data is the base for every thought

---

# Consistency

# Presenter Notes

* One of the apsects for good regulation
* "natural" vs. "digital" perception becomes more and more arbitrary
* digital contact lenses, digital hearing aids
* "mental exoslkeleton"

---
# Let's regulate GLΛSS  

# Presenter Notes

* It was the hook for this talk so let's do it
* given all we know now, how should we regulate glass?

---

# GLΛSS rules (legal)

.fx: bigtext

You may not **publish** video or audio recordings of others without explicit **consent**. <br>(unless it's a public situation).

# Presenter Notes

* consistent
* does not overregulate a person's perception
* gives protection to people who don't want their data published
* Everything else would be overreaching by the government
* (uploading data to backup services is not publication)

---
# GLΛSS rules (social)

* Don't be an ass. 
* If people ask you to deactivate, do so.
* Be transparent with what you do
* Don't assume
* Don't be an ass.

# Presenter Notes

* Try to see the needs of others
* Their wishes might not be rational, but who cares
* Don't annoy anyone without a very good reason
    * Be prepared to get some flak for it

---

# Final thoughts

* regulation seems simple but tends to go overboard
* GLΛSS is nothing new, it just makes something visible
* Cyborgisation has been going on for ages and gains more speed
* Problem: right now no braod consensus

# Presenter Notes

* Regulation is important but can get out of hand
* The Glass Debate is just the first fight
    * a fight especially this subculture is gonna deal with first
* The Future is there but not evenly distributed
