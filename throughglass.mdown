# Regulating technology and data use

# Presenter Notes

* Subtitle
* Talk: How should we regulate tech and data?

---

# Regulation

# Presenter Notes

* Not a popular topic really
* You tend to piss someone off

---

# Examples of Regulation

[Bild Waffen, Pillen, Economy]

# Presenter Notes

* Examples of regulation (amonst others)

---

# Definition 

.fx: bigtext

"Regulation creates, limits, or constrains a right, creates or limits a duty, or allocates a responsibility."

# Presenter Notes

* creating rights? Hellyeah!
* But the rest? Meh to Boooo!

---

# Why regulate?

* Protection
* "General Will"
* Interest Group transfers
* Irreversibility
* ...

# Presenter Notes

* Protecting weaker entities
* "General WilL" vs. the "Will of all" (Rousseau)
* Transfers as in redistribute wealth
* Irreversibility: "We only borrowed the world from our kids"
* There are more but these are key

---

# Who regulates?

* "the Mainstream" 
    * (Social norms)
* Trade associations
* Contracts
* etc. 

But mostly

* The Government

# Presenter Notes

* What you can do without punishment
* Treaties and whatnot

---

# Regulation is about **power**

---

# Examples of regulation of tech

* guns/weapons
* cars
* nuclear power plants

* Bad example: German "Hacker Paragraph"

# Presenter Notes

* they do mostly work
* mostly 

---

# The Hacker Paragraph

# Presenter Notes

* §202c
* Punishment up tp one year
* for giving access or distributing "Hacker Tools"
* We know it's stupid, but what's the actual reason?  

---

# Dual Use

# Presenter Notes

* Technologies that have a bias can be regulated quite well
    * guns
* Technologies with dual use way worse
    * knives
    * hacker tools

---

# What's good regulation?

* As small as possible
* Solves a real problem
* Consistent
* Precise

# Presenter Notes

* It's always a limitation so let's not overuse it
* It needs a clear problem to address
* It has to fit in with the rest of the rules
    * Or it's hard to follow/understand/legitimize
* It needs to be very clear what it forbids/regulates
* always hard to find middle ground
---

# Regulation is hard, why are we even speaking about this shit?

# Presenter notes

* Why not  do something nice?
* Well it's Google's fault

---

# Google GLΛSS

![Google Glass](images/googleglass.jpeg)

# Presenter Notes

* April 4th 2012 first concept video
* Before anyone had any specs we had an outcry
* Glassholes
* "Gargoyles" (Snow Crash, Neil Stephenson)
---

# No Glass Zone

[Bild]

# Presenter Notes

* Was in fact a publicity stunt
* but resonated quite well
* "Glass on the toilet?"

---

# Playing catch-up

# Presenter Notes

* This approach has a big problem
* Whenever you regulte a tech like this you play catch up
* small change: New Product

---

# Some people realized that

# Presenter Notes

* And they chose a wider approach

---

# Stop Cyborgs

[Bild]

# Presenter Notes

* Smarter
* Broader Approach (at least in name)
* Pointed out a big problem

---

# Cyborgs

.fx: bigtext

"A cyborg, short for <br><b>cyb</b>ernetic <b>org</b>anism,<br> is a being with **both**<br> **organic** and **cybernetic** parts."
<span style="font-size:25px">(Wikipedia)</span>

# Presenter Notes

* Enno Park talked about cyborgs yesterday
* Glass makes our own cyborgism visible, perceptible
* (But we have been cyborgs for a long while)
* Our digital exosekeleton belongs to us, is part of us

--- 

# Backfire

# Presenter Notes

* Now we basically declared technological devices parts of us
* that makes regulation hard

---

# "But we are not *really* regulating **devices** we are regulating the gathering and processing of **data**"

# Presenter Notes

* Defense
* People know that regulating devices is hard (dual use)
* In the glass case it's about what people cando with it

---

# What is data?

# Presenter Notes
* we know tech
* we know what works and what doesn't
* So is data regulated like tech?
* What is data?

---

# Data == Cyborg? 

[Bild Data Star Trek]

# Presenter Notes

* Naaa, that isn't right
---

# Short philosophical detour 

# Presenter Notes

* Don't worry it won't hurt


---

# The mind, the body and the world

# Presenter Notes

* You are your mind (software)
* Your mind "runs" on hardware (Body and Brain)
* How do you access the world?
    * Your hardware creates data from the world (somehow)
    * That data often lies
* "You" only have data

---

# End Detour

# Presenter Notes

* And we're back on track

---

# Data is the **representation** of<br> a part of **reality**.

# Presenter Notes

* Data codifies aspects
* Names, Age, color
* Can all be expressed as data

---

# Data is nothing without Interpretation

# Presenter Notes

* What is a "33"? An age? A length? A price?

---

# Data -> Information -> Knowledge

# Presenter Notes

* We transform Data through Interpretation into Information
    * 0111010100 => JPG
* We transform information to knowledge by integrating it in our mind

---

# Data is our world

# Presenter Notes
